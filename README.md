# CapstoneProject1

This repository is a collection for my first capstone project with Springboard. The point of this project is to predict the rainfall amounts for North Carolina for the next 50 years. The data comes from NOWData hosted by NOAA. A sarima model predicts the 95% confidence intervals for the next 50 years using monthly rainfall data from January 1980 to April 2019. Data was sourced from 112 different locations in North Carolina and 10 external locations from South Carolina and Tennessee. Confidence intervals for predictions are provided from May 2019 through May 2069.

The Data folder contains a raw data and manipulated data folders. Raw data contains the data gathered from the all North Carolina locations and possible external locations from South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia. It also contains a csv file that has all of the latitude and longitude coordinates for each location. Manipulated data folder is the data after filtering and filling in missing data. The reports folder contains a final report of the findings, a data wrangling and a data story.
